    "# Decision Rules Document\n",
    "## Federal Budget Variance Analysis\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Purpose:** Defining what matters in federal budget variances and how to prioritize them\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework helps automatically generate one-page decision briefs from federal budget data. The goal is to cut through the noise and identify what actually matters for executive decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach is straightforward: finance leaders never have perfect information, so instead of pretending everything is certain, I'm being transparent about what the data shows, what I'm assuming, and where there's uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 1. MATERIALITY THRESHOLDS\n",
    "### Why Custom Thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than using a single blanket rule like \"5% is material,\" I've set different thresholds for each spending category. The reasoning is simple: a $10 billion variance in Protection (a small $55B category) is massive - that's 18% of the budget. The same $10 billion in Health Care ($1,700B category) barely registers as 0.6%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each threshold is based on:\n",
    "- Category size (larger categories get higher dollar thresholds)\n",
    "- Historical volatility (categories that naturally bounce around get looser thresholds)\n",
    "- Strategic importance (high-visibility items get stricter thresholds)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "| Category | Dollar Threshold | % Threshold | Reasoning |\n",
    "|----------|------------------|-------------|-----------|\n",
    "| Interest | $25B | 3% | Tied to Fed policy, high visibility |\n",
    "| Pensions | $40B | 3% | Social Security is formula-driven |\n",
    "| Health Care | $50B | 5% | Large with some natural volatility |\n",
    "| Defense | $50B | 5% | Large and politically sensitive |\n",
    "| Education | $50B | 15% | Bounces around with policy changes |\n",
    "| Welfare | $75B | 10% | Moves with economic cycles |\n",
    "| Transportation | $25B | 10% | Project timing creates lumpiness |\n",
    "| General Government | $20B | 10% | Administrative and operational costs |\n",
    "| Protection | $10B | 10% | Small, emergency-driven |\n",
    "| Other Spending | $25B | 10% | Catch-all for miscellaneous items |\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Rule\n",
    "A variance is material if it hits either the dollar threshold or the percentage threshold. Both aren't required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How These Were Determined\n",
    "**Dollar thresholds** are set at roughly 3-5% of each category's typical budget size. This keeps them proportional - what's material for a small category should feel equally significant as what's material for a large one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Percentage thresholds** reflect how much each category typically varies:\n",
    "- Stable ones (Pensions, Interest): 3% because they rarely move\n",
    "- Moderate ones (Health Care, Defense): 5% for normal range\n",
    "- Volatile ones (Education): 15% to avoid flagging routine changes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategic adjustments:** Interest gets a tighter 3% threshold despite being large because it directly reflects fiscal sustainability and Fed policy. Education gets a looser 15% threshold because it genuinely changes a lot with policy shifts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "**Interest 2024:** Variance of +$91.1B (+11.55%)  \n",
    "Check: Exceeds $25B? Yes. Exceeds 3%? Yes.  \n",
    "Result: Material\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defense 2024:** Variance of -$32.9B (-2.52%)  \n",
    "Check: Exceeds $50B? No. Exceeds 5%? No.  \n",
    "Result: Not material\n",
    "\n",
    "**Health Care 2024:** Variance of +$55.6B (+3.26%)  \n",
    "Check: Exceeds $50B? Yes. Exceeds 5%? No.  \n",
    "Result: Material (dollar threshold met)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 2. PRIORITY FRAMEWORK\n",
    "### The Three-Tier System\n",
    "\n",
    "When multiple variances are material, I use this tier system to determine which gets top priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tier 1 - Mandatory Spending (Highest)**\n",
    "- Interest, Pensions, Health Care\n",
    "- These are legally required or contractually obligated\n",
    "- Limited ability to adjust in the short term\n",
    "- Variances here indicate structural budget issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tier 2 - Mission-Critical Discretionary (Medium)**\n",
    "- Defense, Education\n",
    "- Core government functions with strategic importance\n",
    "- Adjustable but requires high-level decisions\n",
    "- Variances indicate policy changes or execution issues\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tier 3 - Other Discretionary (Standard)**\n",
    "- Welfare, Transportation, General Government, Protection, Other\n",
    "- Important but more operationally flexible\n",
    "- Typically managed at agency level\n",
    "- Variances handled through normal processes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Direction Matters\n",
    "Within the same tier, overruns take priority over underruns. Overruns create immediate budget pressure and need corrective action. Underruns might represent opportunities but are less urgent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception: Massive underruns (over 25%) may signal program execution problems and warrant investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real Example\n",
    "FY 2024 had these material variances:\n",
    "- Interest: +$91.1B (Tier 1, overrun)\n",
    "- Health Care: +$55.6B (Tier 1, overrun)  \n",
    "- Education: +$86.0B (Tier 2, overrun)\n",
    "- Welfare: -$309.0B (Tier 3, underrun)\n",
    "\n",
    "Interest wins despite Welfare having the largest absolute variance. Why? Tier 1 beats Tier 3, and within Tier 1, Interest's $91.1B beats Health Care's $55.6B.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 3. PRIMARY ISSUE SELECTION\n",
    "### The Four-Step Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Every brief focuses on exactly one issue. Here's how I pick it:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1:** Filter to material variances only. Exclude anything below thresholds and any rows without actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2:** Apply the tier system. Look at Tier 1 first. If nothing material there, move to Tier 2, then Tier 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3:** Sort by dollar impact. Within the selected tier, pick the largest absolute variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4:** Break ties if needed. If two are within 10% of each other:\n",
    "- Overrun beats underrun\n",
    "- Higher percentage wins\n",
    "- More recent year wins\n",
    "- Alphabetical order as last resort\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supporting Context\n",
    "The brief will mention up to 2 other material variances if they're significant (over 50% of primary issue) and add relevant context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Escalation Triggers\n",
    "If there are 5+ material variances across multiple tiers, or if total variances exceed 10% of budget, I flag it as a systemic issue requiring comprehensive review rather than a focused brief.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 4. CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT\n",
    "### Scoring Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Every analysis gets a confidence score from 0-100% based on four factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Quality (30 points possible)**\n",
    "- 30 points: Complete actual data, no gaps\n",
    "- 15 points: Minor gaps (under 10% missing)\n",
    "- 0 points: Significant gaps or preliminary data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Consistency (30 points possible)**\n",
    "- 30 points: Two-year consistent pattern\n",
    "- 15 points: Shows up in one year only\n",
    "- 0 points: Erratic or no discernible pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "**Driver Clarity (30 points possible)**\n",
    "- 30 points: Single clear driver\n",
    "- 15 points: Multiple contributing factors\n",
    "- 0 points: Unclear what's causing it\n",
    "\n",
    "**Magnitude (10 points possible)**\n",
    "- 10 points: Over 20% variance\n",
    "- 5 points: 10-20% variance\n",
    "- 0 points: 5-10% variance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confidence Bands\n",
    "**High (85-100%):** Solid data, clear pattern, known driver. Recommend taking action.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Medium (60-84%):** Good sense of what's happening but some gaps. Recommend action with monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Low (under 60%):** Something flagged but not enough information yet. Need investigation or better data before recommending action.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Dataset Examples\n",
    "**Interest 2024:** 95% confidence\n",
    "- Complete data (30), both years over budget (30), Fed rate hikes clearly driving it (30), 11.55% variance (5)\n",
    "- Total: 95 points\n",
    "\n",
    "**Education 2024:** 40% confidence  \n",
    "- Complete data (30), but pattern is all over the place - 2023 was -94%, 2024 was +36% (0), unclear driver (0), 36% magnitude (10)\n",
    "- Total: 40 points\n",
    "- Note: The erratic pattern raises questions about data quality or unusual circumstances\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## 5. DATA SCOPE\n",
    "### What's Included\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis covers FY 2023 and FY 2024 - 10 categories across 2 years for 20 total data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each year:\n",
    "- Budget uses the original estimate from that year's budget document\n",
    "- Actual is the final reconciled spending (no preliminary figures)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Excluded\n",
    "\n",
    "FY 2025 is in the dataset but flagged as \"No Actuals Available.\" The fiscal year ended September 2025 but final numbers aren't published yet. The Excel file keeps it for reference, but the Python code will filter it out during analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Budget Estimate Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important: I use the original budget estimate from the start of each fiscal year, not later re-estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? Each year's budget document re-estimates future years with updated information. For FY 2024 Health Care:\n",
    "- FY 2022 Budget: estimated $1,680B\n",
    "- FY 2023 Budget: estimated $1,700B  \n",
    "- FY 2024 Budget: estimated $1,703B (this is what I use)\n",
    "- FY 2025 Budget: estimated $1,720B\n",
    "\n",
    "Using later re-estimates essentially moves the goalposts. Variance analysis should measure performance against what was planned at the start of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "All unusual variances (over ±25%) were verified against source data:\n",
    "- Education 2023 (-94%): Confirmed, reflects major policy change\n",
    "- Welfare 2024 (-40%): Confirmed, reflects program adjustments\n",
    "- Interest 2023 (+66%): Confirmed, reflects Fed rate increases\n",
    "\n",
